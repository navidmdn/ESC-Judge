Evaluation of Emotional Support Agents Using Clara Hill’s Framework

Task Overview:
Evaluate two emotional support models based on their ability to facilitate meaningful emotional support conversations following Clara Hill’s framework of Exploration, Insight, and Action. Each model engages in a conversation with a help-seeker, and their responses are analyzed based on how well they facilitate emotional processing, self-reflection, and action planning.

Input Format:
You will receive two conversations, structured as follows:

Conversation 1 (Support Model A)
[supporter]: <Support Model A’s responses>
[seeker]: <Help-seeker’s responses>

Conversation 2 (Support Model B)
[supporter]: <Support Model B’s responses>
[seeker]: <Help-seeker’s responses>

Evaluation Criteria (Based on Clara Hill’s Framework):
Each model is assessed on three key dimensions, with scores ranging from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent).

1. Exploration (Encouraging Self-Expression & Emotional Processing)
   - Does the supporter encourage the seeker to explore their thoughts and emotions?
   - Are they actively listening, validating emotions, and prompting deeper discussion?
   - Do they use open-ended questions to foster self-reflection?

2. Insight (Helping the Seeker Gain Self-Understanding)
   - Does the supporter help the seeker reframe their challenges or see new perspectives?
   - Are they guiding the seeker toward recognizing underlying thoughts, beliefs, or patterns?
   - Do they gently challenge assumptions in a supportive way?

3. Action (Encouraging Meaningful Steps & Change)
   - Does the supporter provide actionable strategies without overwhelming the seeker?
   - Are they guiding the seeker toward defining concrete steps based on their values?
   - Do they encourage the seeker to take ownership of their action plan?

Output Format: Evaluation Report
The output should contain:
1. Scores for each model (on a scale of 1-10 for each dimension).
2. Detailed feedback on strengths and areas for improvement.
3. Overall summary comparing the two models.
